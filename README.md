# Tweeter Demo

This Android application comes from a BYU class on Design Patterns. Most of the UX code was given to us and then we had to refactor, optimize and add to that base. For example, we reduced code duplication, added a server with API Gateway / Lambda, etc.  

**Milestone 1:** Creating a domain model and some sequence diagrams for our application with UML

**Milestone 2A:** Refactoring to Model-View-Presenter with the Observer Pattern (to communicate from lower to higher layers)

**Milestone 2B:** Remove code duplication via inheritance (e.g. template method), composition/delegation, and generic types

**Milestone 2C:** Testing frontend with JUnit and Mockito

**Milestone 3:** Serverless architecture with Facade / Proxy pattern, various lambda functions, and API gateway to delegate requests

**Milestone 4A:** Creating DAOs for DynamoDB with dependency injection / abstract factory, and implementing the keys, tokens, picture storage, salting/hashing, etc relating to the database

**Milestone 4B:** Using SQS in conjunction wiht Lambdas to process posting to 10000 users asynchronously

**Milestone 4C:** Testing backend with JUnit and Mockito


## Synopsis

This project was an Android app that mimics that way X (formerly Twitter) works. You can login or register as a new user, view your feed, your story and followees/followers, find new friends to follow, and create your own posts for friends to see -- most of the things you'd expect to see from a Twitter clone application.
