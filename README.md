# Tweeter Demo

This Android application comes from a BYU class on Design Patterns. Most of the UX code was given to us and then we had to refactor, optimize and add to that base. For example, we reduced code duplication through inheritance, composition/delegation, and generic types. 

**Synopsis**

This project was an Android app that mimics that way X (formerly Twitter) works. You can login or register as a new user, view your feed, your story and followees/followers, find new friends to follow, and create your own posts for friends to see -- most of the things you'd expect to see from a Twitter clone application. You can view a couple of screenshots I took.
